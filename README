The Z-Shell Empire Client currently comes in two flavors.

zec is a standalone script which resembles traditional Empire clients.  You
invoke it, execute your game actions, and exit.

zecsh is an experimental add-on to your normal shell environment, allowing
you to intermingle Empire commands with standard shell constructs.
